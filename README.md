# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Description
This project was developed as part of Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course, representing the capstone of the Front-End Development Track.

The website features a booking application integrated into the Little Lemon Website, demonstrating the use of React components to build and manage the site's functionality. It also includes API calls to enhance its capabilities.

Please note: Currently, the only fully functional feature is the "Reserve a Table" functionality. The rest of the site primarily focuses on design elements.
